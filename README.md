Line shapes orbiting a point in space 

I'm working on making a semi borealis effect for the browser.  

This examples allows the user to adjust the alpha channel of the shapes as well as changing the orbit location.  

I'd like to have the center point of the lines move around the space but I haven't found an efficient way to do this yet.
